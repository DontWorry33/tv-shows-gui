#ABOUT THE PROGRAM
------------------

This program allows users to watch any TV show hosted on primewire.ag, on a user-friendly GUI.

The program contains no ads and runs quickly, as no images are loaded.

The GUI is simple to use. 
Choose a TV show and select a season and episode to watch the show.

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
-----------------------

KEY VERIFICATION:

The program will grab a key from PrimeWire as it loads. The key is necessary to add shows into the program. 
Fetching the key can take up to 15 seconds. 
If the loading message does not go away after 15 seconds, restart the program. 
Once the program is finished loading, a message box saying "Verified" will appear.


WATCHING SHOWS:

The column on the far left of the program displays the shows currently in your local database. 
Click a show to load the seasons and episodes. 
Click a season and to view a list of episodes in that season. 
After clicking an episode, the link to the episode will show on the column to the far right. 
Click that link and the program will open up your default web browser.


ADDING SHOWS:

To add a show, type in a show name on the search bar. 
The search bar is located on the column on the far left of the program, above the 3 buttons. 
If the search bar is empty, an error message will appear. 
After you type in a show name and click Add Show, another window will appear. 
Once the window loads, you will see a list of shows that are related to your query. 
To add a show into your database, click the show you want and click Add. 
A message box should appear, confirming that you have successfully added a show. 
**VERY IMPORTANT**: After you add a show, DO **NOT** CLICK THE X ON THE TOP RIGHT. 
Click the Close button instead, located to the right of the Add button. 
Clicking the X will break the Add Show function.

DELETING SHOWS:

Select the show you wish to delete. Shows are located on the left-most side of the program. 
After clicking the show, click the Delete Show button.
A confirmation message box will appear.
Click yes to delete and no to cancel. 
The show will no longer be viewable on the program once it is deleted. 
To get the show back, you must re-add the show. See ADDING SHOWS. 


SEARCHING FOR SHOWS:

Scrolling to find a show in your database can be time-consuming. Use the search bar instead.
Type a show name in the search bar and click Search. 
If nothing happens, the show was not found. 
To return to the list of shows, remove all text from the search bar and click Search again.
