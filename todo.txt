MORE
*****************
*Have a "watched shows" category 
    - checkboxes (check to mark watched, uncheck to unmark)
    - display/hide watched episodes
    - marked as watch after clicking link (pop-up box to confirm)
    
*Release date
    - Text version implemented, if link is clicked, will show release date in terminal.
    	- Need to add column in episode box (internally) so it will display the dates.
    	
    - Have category next to "epside" in third box from left which shows date

*New episodes
    - If there is a show in local DB with new ep's, program should notify


     
*Downloading of season/episode list and save it locally for future use (much faster)

********
BUGS
********
*If episode has no name (blank on website), span class tv_episode_name does not exist therefor there is no entry for the name and it skips it. (Line 144 watchshows2.py)

*In GUI currently, when there is a mass amount of links, the GUI expands vertically and you are unable to un-expand it. To fix, add scrolling bar to links box (very right box)
